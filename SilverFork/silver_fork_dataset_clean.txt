SILVER FORK NOVELS

Most of these novels were first published, many of them anonymously, in three small octavo volumes. Henry Colburn was the publisher of the great majority. They were expensive, one and a half guineas the set of three volumes being the usual price; but they were very well bound and a pleasure to read: well spaced print-lines and wide margins. Reprints in 'Bentley's Standard Novels and Romances' series, (started in 183 I) and in Colburn's 'Modern Standard Novelists' series (started in 1835) were in one volume, with closer, smaller print.
