Bibliographies SILVER FORK NOVELS Most of these novels were first published, many of them anonymously, in three small octavo volumes. Henry Colburn was the publisher of the great majority. They were expensive, one and a half guineas the set of three volumes being the usual price; but they were very well bound and a pleasure to read: well spaced print-lines and wide margins. Reprints in 'Bentley's Standard Novels and Romances' series, (started in 183 I) and in Colburn's 'Modern Standard Novelists' series (started in 1835) were in one volume, with closer, smaller print. MARGUERITE, COUNTESS OF BLESSINGTON 1833  The Repealers  1835  The Two Friends  1836  The Confessio11;s ofan Elderly Gentleman  1837  The Victims ofSociery  1838  The Confessions ofan Elderly Lady  1839  The Governess  1842  The Lottery ofLife  Lady Blessington wrote four more novels before her death in  1859.  EDWARD GEORGE EARLE LYTTON BULWER (created Baron Lytton ofKnebworth, 1866) 1822 Greville (unfinished) 182 7 Falkland 1828 Pelham 1829 Devereux 1829 The Disowned BIBLIOGRAPHY 321 1830 Paul Clifford v 1833 Godolphin 1837 Ernest M altravers 1838 Alice, or the Mysteries (sequel to Ernest Maltravers) LADY CHARLOTTE BURY 18'2'2 Conduct is Fate 18'26 Alla Giornata 18'28 Flirtation 18'28 A Alarriage in High Life 1830 The Separation 1830 Journal oJthe Heart 1830 The Exclusives 1834 The Disinherited 1835 Journal ojthe Heart, '2nd series 1836 The Devoted 1837 The Divorced 1837 Love 1840 The History oja Flirt 1841 Famity Records 1842 The Manoeuvring Alother Lady Charlotte Bury wrote two more novels before she died in 1861 BENJAMIN DISRAELI (I st Earl ofBeaconsfield, 1876) 18'26-7 Vivian Grey
